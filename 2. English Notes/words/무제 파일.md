i need to practice english because we have to <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">collaborate</mark> with the American branch

collaborate  (work together)
decide

-------------------------------

what do you think is the <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">optimum</mark> time to go to bed at night?

original
optimum == best

------------------------------------

when he told me about his experience, i realized how <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">resilient</mark> kids are

resistant : 저항력 있는 ~잘 견디는               
ex)  plants that are resistant to disease 질병에 강한 식물들
ex)  elderly people are not always resistance to change : 노인들이라고 항상 변화에 반대하는 것은 아니다

resilient : easily recover from difficult situations
