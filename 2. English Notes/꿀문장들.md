### 꿀문장 

it started off really well
시작은 괜찮았어

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">i dont know if it was because</mark> of its exotic setting, but 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">the first several episodes</mark> were really interesting
이국적인 <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">설정때문이었는지는 몰라도</mark> 첫 몇 편은 정말 재밌었어

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">it wasnt until</mark> the 4th or 5th episode <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">that i started to get</mark> a little antsy
4화 5화에피소에선 안그랬는데 그이후에 답답해지기 시작했어

it wasnt until : 그때까진 안그랬는데, 그이후로 ~~ 이러기 시작했다.
* antsy : 빨리빨리!! 하 답답해 (형용사)* 비슷한거 (impatient)

~~ 가 되니깐!! (이런느낌은 it wasnt until)

i mean, i am pretty patient when it comes to these things, but i feel
like there were some parts <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">that didnt really add to the story,</mark> and felt more like distractions

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">that didnt really add to the stroy</mark> : 이야기에 도움이 안됬
distractions : 산만하게 하는것

About <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">halfway throught the first season </mark> was when the cracks (really)
started to show for me
첫 시즌 중간 쯤 가니까

the cracks (really) started to show for me (문제가 표면상에 서서히 드러나다, 구멍이 서서히 보이기 시작했다.)

it felt like they were <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">taking bits and pieces from here and there.</mark>
it just lacked originality

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">taking bits and pieces from here and there</mark>
: 여기저기서 짜집기한느낌

originality
독창성


첫 시즌이 끝날 때쯤 되니까 계속 봐야 하는 건지 모르겠더라고
By the time the first season came to an end
By the time(움직이던게 끝날때쯤 되니까 느낌)
